## TODO's
1. Schema validation of payload/query-attributes by reitit     
   - Validation should work for swagger-ui/curl     
2. Swagger-ui field-validation need additional definitions, otherwise:
   1. negative page/size values are possible
   2. definition of default-values/preset values is not possible
3. Add request/response-example if it makes sense   
4. Add tests
5. In general requests that fetching many records should use pagination/size
